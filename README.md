## Recipe 1: using string functions on buffers  
Advanced Node.js, Samer Buna, Pluralsight, (February 16, 2017)  
- the same methods are available for both strings and buffers
---

## Recipe 2: using string decoder
Advanced Node.js, Samer Buna, Pluralsight, (February 16, 2017)  
- StringDecoder is more reliable than Buffer.toString() when receiving text
expecially in Unicode in binary since some characters may span 16 bytes.

## Recipe 3: custom entrypoint for a node package
Advanced Node.js, Samer Buna, Pluralsight, (February 16, 2017)  
- custom entrypoints to a package can be defined in the "main" property
in the package.json file

## Recipe 4: determining if package is executed as a script or if being required by another script
Advanced Node.js, Samer Buna, Pluralsight, (February 16, 2017)  
- require.main contains metadata regarding the entrypoint module for the executed script
and it will be the exact same object as the module param wrapping the entrypoint script.
This provides a means of determining how a module came to be executed.
- execute index.js which requires printStars.js or run printStars.js and provide the required
command line arguments.
